# Drone-visual-servoing-with-a-controller-in-MATLAB
A ROS package to control a copter so that it follows ArUco patterns with the bottom camera. When using in Loiter mode, the system uses a controller in ROS. When the drone is in Guided mode, the system is connected to a controller in MATLAB/Simulink.

# To do list
* Test FOPD controller;
* Add a PID controller to make a close loop;
* Send data to Terminal and copy them to text file;
* Add FOPD controller and log data;
* Plot curve to compare the captured data.
